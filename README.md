# HAIR

HAIR turns IR remotes into native Home Assistant entities. Point any remote at an IR receiver and press a button, and HAIR gives you back a device, a button, and an event you can automate. No vendor cloud, no YAML, nothing learned into somebody else's box.

## Install

### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the HAIR repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=DAB-LABS&repository=HAIR&category=integration)

Click the button above, then **Download**, then restart Home Assistant.

Or find it by hand:

1. Open **HACS** in your Home Assistant sidebar.
2. Search for **HAIR**.
3. Click it, then **Download**.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/hair` into your HA `custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### Add the integration

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for "HAIR".
3. The config flow auto-detects your IR emitters and receivers.
4. Find **HAIR** in the sidebar.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant **2026.4** or later. **2026.6+** is recommended for native IR receivers.
- **To capture (RX):** an integration exposing HA's native `InfraredReceiverEntity`. ESPHome IR receivers work day one; SMLIGHT Ultima receivers work natively since HA 2026.7; MQTT IR hubs work since HA 2026.8, though most only listen inside a short learn-mode window that has to be re-armed; any other adopter works automatically.
- **To send (TX):** at least one integration on HA's native `infrared` platform, such as ESPHome, [Tuya Local](https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local), Broadlink, SMLIGHT, or MQTT.

These integrations have adopted the `infrared` platform:

| Integration | TX | RX | Pluck | Since |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) | Yes | Yes | No | 2026.4 (TX), 2026.6 (native RX) |
| [Tuya Local](https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local) | Yes | No | Yes | TX 2026.4, Pluck 2026.6.2 |
| [Broadlink](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/broadlink/) | Yes | No | Yes | 2026.5 |
| [SMLIGHT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/smlight/) | Yes | Yes | No | TX 2026.5, native RX (Ultima) 2026.7 |
| [MQTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) | Yes | Yes | No | 2026.8 |

Pluck reads codes an integration has already stored in Home Assistant. For Broadlink that means codes learned with `remote.learn_command`: a blaster you have only ever transmitted through has nothing to pluck yet, and codes learned in the Broadlink phone app stay in Broadlink's cloud and never reach Home Assistant. This applies to every RM model Home Assistant supports, not only the newer ones.

As more integrations adopt the `infrared` platform, HAIR picks them up automatically.

## Quick start

To go from a fresh install to a working button:

1. Point your remote at the IR receiver and press a button. HAIR shows it live on the **Sniffer** tab.
2. Hover over the remote's name and click it to rename it (optional).
3. Click **USE**, then **Make a Device**. HAIR creates a device with a button entity for every signal you captured.
4. Open the device and press one of its buttons. Home Assistant sends the code through your emitter.

## Capture a remote

The Sniffer is a live listener. It shows every signal your receivers hear, groups signals by the remote they came from, and filters out repeat frames from a held-down button. A new remote needs at least three presses before HAIR trusts it enough to show it as its own card, so give it a few before you go looking for it.

To capture a remote:

1. Open the **Sniffer** tab.
2. Point the remote at your receiver and press buttons. Each source remote appears as a card, expandable to show its individual signals with an S/L diamond fingerprint.
3. Click a signal's diamond pattern to give it an alias, so you can tell buttons apart before you assign them.
4. Click **Test** on a signal to fire it through an emitter and confirm it works.
5. Click a signal to assign it to a device, or **USE** the whole remote to make a new Device or Remote.

When you assign a signal, pick a name from the device-type template list (Power On, Volume Up, Mode: Cool) or type your own, and set a Send Times count if the device needs a command repeated to register; you can change this later in the editor. For an AC device, naming commands "Temp 22" or "Temp 24" wires them straight into the climate card's thermostat control, stepped to whatever temperatures you name. Assigning copies the signal into the device rather than removing it from the Sniffer, so you can assign the same signal to several devices or commands; an assigned row keeps flashing when you press its button, so you can tell the remote is still alive. Drag the grip handle on a remote, or on a signal row, to reorder them; the order sticks.

A remote that leaks in from outside (a neighbor's clicker, for example) can be hidden with the eye at the bottom-right corner of its row and brought back later with **Show hidden**; a hidden remote wears a small "hidden" badge and the open eye restores it. A dot lights up on the Show hidden button if a hidden remote is still transmitting in the background. The X at the top-right corner of a row deletes the remote, and the trash can on a signal row deletes that one signal; both controls stay faint until you hover the row. Anything a receiver hears again comes right back after a delete, so hiding is the tool for keeping a remote out of the way for good. A remote already used to make a Device or Remote shows a count dot on **USE**; click it to jump to what you made, or use it again for a second room.

## Turn signals into a device

Any captured, pasted, or plucked set of codes can become a Device, something HAIR sends codes to, or a Remote, a handset HAIR recognizes and fires triggers from.

To turn a set of codes into a Device or Remote:

1. Find the set of codes: a remote in the **Sniffer** (see [Capture a remote](#capture-a-remote)), a pasted remote in the **Clipper**, a pulled remote in the **Plucker**, or a wig in the **Closet** (see [Import codes](#import-codes-smartir-and-the-closet)).
2. Click **USE**.
3. Choose **Make a Device** or **Make a Remote**, name it, and pick hardware -- emitters for a Device, receivers for a Remote.
4. Click Create.

The Clipper is for pasting a Pronto code by hand; the Plucker pulls codes already learned into a vendor blaster, such as a Tuya Local IR blaster, without transmitting anything over the air.

For a Device, open it afterward and click **ACTIONS** on a command to map it to an entity action, such as `turn_on` or `volume_up`; only mapped actions show up as controls, so an entity never claims a feature your remote does not have.

You can also click the dashed tile at the end of the grid to start one from scratch, or drop a code file onto it so HAIR opens the add dialog already filled in; dropping does not create anything by itself, and completing the dialog files the codes as a wig in your Closet at the same time it creates the Device or Remote. To duplicate a Device instead, use its card; commands and emitter assignments come with it, so you only rename the clone.

<!-- screenshot: dashed add tile, Devices/Remotes grid -->

Each Remote you make is its own device in Home Assistant, so its triggers show up by name under Device in the automation editor; click its header's Home Assistant glyph to jump there.

A Device can also build you a matching Remote, and a Remote a matching Device: open the gear, click **Make a Remote** or **Make a Device**, and name it. HAIR then asks whether to pin the two together; see [Set up triggers](#set-up-triggers).

<!-- screenshot: add dialog, source tabs, Device/Remote choice -->

<p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/promote-dialog.png" alt="Adopt dialog for creating a new HAIR device from an unknown remote" width="420"></p>

## Set up an air conditioner

An AC remote does not send single buttons, it sends whole states: every press carries the complete mode, fan, swing, and temperature the unit should switch to. HAIR handles that as a climate entity driven by a full state matrix instead of a list of commands.

To set one up:

1. Drop a SmartIR climate JSON file onto the **Closet** (or find one already there).
2. Click **USE**, then **Make a Device**.
3. HAIR creates a fully-controlled `climate` entity. Change the temperature or mode on the thermostat card, and HAIR looks up and sends the matching code.

Swing and temperature controls appear only when the file's matrix actually has those dimensions. The device's detail page grows a STATE MATRIX card where you can browse the lattice one branch at a time, see which state was last transmitted, send any state directly, or press **+ Command** to save one you use often as a one-tap command. A Power row sits at the top of the card: an Off chip always, an On chip when the file carries a separate wake code, and either one sends or saves as a command the same way a cell does. Temperatures display in your install's unit while the file's native numbers stay untouched underneath; climate files are read as Celsius unless they say otherwise. To prove the matrix works on your hardware, run **Fit This Wig** (see [Fit a wig](#fit-a-wig)); the checklist covers 12 to 20 rows for the modes, fan speeds, swing positions, and temperature extremes instead of every cell.

Every command row on an AC Device also has a star; click it to make that command a thermostat preset in Home Assistant, named after the command, click again to remove it. This works for learned commands and for states saved from the STATE MATRIX card with **+ Command**. Presets are local to the device and do not travel with a wig.

<!-- screenshot: preset star on AC command row -->

**Listen to the wall remote.** An air-conditioner handset can also be a Remote: it shows the same STATE MATRIX card, but for listening, with a **LAST HEARD** row naming the last state, when, and which receiver heard it. Browse to a state and click **+ Trigger** to fire on exactly that state, or use the Remote's **"State heard"** trigger to fire on any state with mode, fan, swing, and temperature as data. Pin it to a Device (see [Set up triggers](#set-up-triggers)) and every state it sends gets re-sent there, so Home Assistant and the wall remote never disagree.

<!-- screenshot: AC Remote STATE MATRIX card lit up, LAST HEARD row -->

A few limits to know: files whose codes are stored as Xiaomi-controller Raw are refused on import, since that format is proprietary rather than timing data HAIR can convert. Of the cells that do convert, a small share (roughly half a percent) fail and are skipped, with the reason written into the wig's notes; HAIR never invents a code for a state the file does not carry.

If the comb flags a cell, it stays in the matrix and shows up under **Needs attention** on the device. See [Fix codes that need attention](#fix-codes-that-need-attention).

## Import codes (SmartIR and the closet)

The Closet is where portable code sets, called wigs, live. Two kinds of entries hang there: codebooks installed with Home Assistant's core infrared code library, and your own wig files, organized by brand. Search covers brand, name, and product identifiers like UPC, FCC ID, or ASIN, so a barcode typed off the box finds its wig. The Closet also converts several outside formats the moment you drop them in.

To import a file:

1. Open the **Closet** tab.
2. Drag a file onto the tab, or click **Browse**. HAIR reads it, converts it if needed, and shows a receipt naming the brand it filed under.
3. If the codes are already in your closet, the receipt turns yellow and lists every place they already hang. If the file supersedes a wig you already have, HAIR offers to replace the old one instead of filing a duplicate.
4. Click **USE** to make a Device or Remote from the entry, or **CLIP** to test it on the Clipper first.

Five formats convert on drop: wig files (`.wig.json`, filed as-is), SmartIR JSON (media player, fan, and climate, in all four SmartIR encodings), Flipper Zero `.ir` files, LIRC `lircd.conf` files, and Girr exports. Anything a conversion has to skip is written into the wig's notes with a reason, so a partial import is never silent.

You can also skip these steps: drop a code file straight onto the dashed add tile on the Devices tab (see [Turn signals into a device](#turn-signals-into-a-device)), and HAIR files it as a wig in your Closet and creates the Device or Remote in the same step.

Good to know: a Remote made from a wig, or a Device adopted from one, recognizes its own handset's presses even though HAIR never learned those codes through a receiver.

Every arrival is also combed on the way in. Combing is a different question from fitting: a fitting asks whether a code works on your hardware, combing asks whether a wig's codes agree with each other, and it can answer that on its own, without hardware or a protocol decoder. It catches things like a cell that quietly sends its neighbor's code, a frame too short for the device to register, or a gap in an otherwise complete temperature run. The comb glyph on a closet row stays plain grey until something is checked, glows yellow when a finding needs a look, and glows red for the one class worth interrupting you for: the neighbor's-code mix-up, since the device answers and looks like it worked while quietly setting the wrong state.

![Closet tab with brand shelves, count chips, the oxblood drop bar, and library and personal wigs side by side](images/screenshots/closet.png)

## Fix codes that need attention

When the comb finds a problem in a wig, the device made from it shows a **Needs attention** block above its commands. Each row is one code and a reason.

To fix a code:

1. Click **Fix** on the card.
2. Do what the card asks. Some fixes are ready to accept. Some need a press from your remote, or a corrected code you paste in. Some ask you to pick between two buttons that share a name.
3. The row goes away. The device sends the fixed code from then on.

A code still sends as-is until you fix it, so nothing here stops you from using the device.

## Share a wig

To share a device you have built:

1. Open the device's detail view.
2. Click **Save to Closet**.
3. Pick a route: **Save as New** files a fresh wig and leaves the original alone. **Update Closet Wig** brings the shared file up to date with your device, and warns you first if the update would retire someone else's fitting. **Fit This Wig** records which commands you have proved on real hardware, see [Fit a wig](#fit-a-wig) below.

**Fit This Wig** only appears on a device that came from a wig in the first place. A device built from scratch just sees Save.

## Fit a wig

A wig in your closet is a saved set of codes. A fitting is proof those codes actually work, and the proof travels with the file from then on. There are two names for what comes out: a wig, which is any shared code set, and a **Perfect Fit**, which is a wig one person proved every row of in one sitting. A wig nobody has finished proving is the ordinary case for a shared remote, not a broken one.

To fit a wig:

1. Adopt the wig onto a device and use it normally until you trust it.
2. Open the device, click **Save to Closet**, and choose **Fit This Wig**.
3. Hit **TEST** on each row of the checklist. HAIR reports SENT, or SENT and HEARD if a receiver caught the transmission. The checklist covers every lattice the wig carries, so a wig with presets lists each preset's rows under its own name.
4. Check the rows you have proved. Check some of them and the button reads **Save Fitting**: your claims go on the file, and the closet lists the fitting with how far it got. Check all of them and it reads **Save Perfect Fit**. Check none and it is a plain **Save**, with no claims attached. On a state-matrix checklist, a dimension your unit genuinely does not have can be marked "not on my device" or "could not make it work" instead of checked. Three people excluding the same dimension tells you something real is going on.
5. If your device has gained or dropped commands since the wig was last saved, review the **Changes with new fitting** section before you sign.
6. Sign. Your verdicts tie to a key generated on your own install, not the name you type, so nobody can edit your results or fit in your name. Fitting the same wig again later just replaces your old signature.

A Perfect Fit is one person's work. If somebody else proved half the wig before you, your checklist still starts empty: the green tick says one person found the whole thing working on their own hardware, and two half-fittings do not add up to that. The closet still counts what everybody proved between them, because that is worth knowing on its own.

Fix flagged codes under **Needs attention** before you fit. A fitting waits until that block is empty, because a claim about codes nobody has answered the doubts on is not a claim worth signing. To fix a code the comb did not catch, open the command, paste in a corrected Pronto code or press **LISTEN**, then save. A repaired wig is a different wig, so any change starts a brand new fitting with only your signature on it.

Give the device a beat between presses so you can watch it react before marking a row. Fittings are what make a shared wig trustworthy, and only perfect-fit wigs can graduate into generated Home Assistant integrations.

## Set up triggers

Any IR signal can fire a Home Assistant automation as a native event entity.

To create a trigger:

1. Click the trigger button on a signal row, and pick which Remote it belongs to -- **HAIR Triggers** by default, or **+ New Remote** to make one on the spot. There are four places to find a signal to trigger from: a command on a device, a signal in the Sniffer, a signal in the Clipper, or a recorded send in the Mirror.
2. Set **min hits** (1 to 10) if you want to require more than one press before the trigger fires. This filters out stray or accidental presses.
3. Save. HAIR creates an `event` entity (for example `event.hair_triggers_tv_power`) under a shared "HAIR Triggers" device.
4. Use that entity as a trigger condition in HA's automation editor. Its card flashes amber in the panel whenever it fires.

Only **HAIR Triggers** lets you pick a receiver; a named Remote's triggers follow whichever receivers it already uses, and cannot move to another Remote later.

A trigger created from a Sniffer or Clipper row reacts to a raw signal without needing it assigned to a device first. A trigger created from a Mirror row only fires on signals arriving from outside Home Assistant; the house's own sends never fire it, so an automation cannot trigger on its own output.

**Pin a Remote to a Device** and pressing the handset sends the matching command through that Device's emitters; HAIR matches the button to the command on its own. Open the **PIN** row on the Remote's header, or **PINNED** on the Device's, and tick the other side; untick to unpin. One Remote can drive several Devices, and one Device several Remotes. HAIR never re-fires its own sends, so a pinned handset by the receiver will not loop, and a runaway pairing gets cut for a minute and logged without breaking the handset's triggers.

<!-- screenshot: Remote PIN row, Device PINNED row -->

<p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/trigger-dialog.png" alt="Create Trigger dialog with S/L diamond pattern and min hits setting" width="420"></p>

## Use the Mirror

The Mirror logs every IR command Home Assistant sends, at the moment it is sent, and whether a receiver heard it land.

To use it:

1. Send a command from a device, a Test button, an automation, or another integration on the `infrared` platform.
2. Open the **Mirror** tab and find the row.
3. Check the heard-back column. "Not heard" is neutral, not an alarm, since many setups are transmit-only, but it is how you spot a dead IR LED, a misaimed emitter, or an offline device without pointing a phone camera at anything.
4. Use the **Search** box, the **Not heard** pill, or the **Emitter** dropdown to narrow the list to one emitter.
5. Click **Assign** on a row to turn a command another app sent into a HAIR command, or **Trigger** to turn it into an automation trigger.

Repeat sends of the same command bump one row's count instead of piling up. Deleting a row just clears the entry; it comes back the next time that signal is sent. The Mirror is also the third road for importing codes, next to the Clipper (paste) and the Plucker (pull by name): press a button in any vendor app whose blaster transmits through the `infrared` platform, and if a receiver hears it, the code appears in the Mirror ready to assign.

![Mirror tab logging every HA-originated IR send with provenance chips, heard-by areas, and send counts](images/screenshots/mirror-tab.png)

## Everything else

### How it works

HAIR does not talk to hardware directly. It sits on HA's native `infrared` platform for both capture and send, so any integration that adopts the platform works with HAIR automatically, and signals are matched with S/L pulse-duration fingerprinting rather than per-protocol decoding.

### The Devices tab

The tab splits into two sections. **DEVICES** holds the things HAIR sends codes to: **HAIR Devices** (your managed profiles; drag to reorder, duplicate or delete from the corners of the card), **Emitters** and **Receivers** (your IR hardware, each showing a TX or RX badge, with `-NATIVE` or `-BRIDGE` marking which path a receiver is using), **Proxies** (hardware with both TX and RX on one board), and **Blasters** (pluckable vendor blasters, shown only when one is configured). **REMOTES** holds the handsets HAIR recognizes; **HAIR Triggers**, the built-in catch-all, is the first card there, and a Remote card shows how many of its triggers are on and off.

<!-- screenshot: Devices tab, DEVICES and REMOTES sections -->

![Devices overview showing HAIR Devices, Triggers, Emitters, Receivers, and Proxies](images/screenshots/devices-overview.png)

### Editing signals and commands

Every signal and command has a copy/edit glyph that opens a single editor: read the raw Pronto code, copy it, or replace it by pasting a new code or pressing **LISTEN** to capture it fresh off the remote. Editing updates the fingerprint and decoded identity, and moves any trigger bound to that signal along with it. Renaming a command updates any action mapping that pointed at the old name. A device command is a copy of the signal it was assigned from, so editing a catalog signal in the Sniffer or Clipper does not change commands already assigned from it; edit the command on the device itself to change what that device transmits. If a signal's carrier reads off the common IR standards, the editor offers a "Snap to N kHz" button that re-encodes it to the nearest standard (30, 33, 36, 38, 40, or 56 kHz) before you save.

The same editor carries the two transmit knobs. **Send times** is how many times the whole code goes out as independent presses, for gear that needs a repeat to register. **Spacing** is the gap between those presses, measured from the start of one to the start of the next, and it turns on as soon as send times rises above 1. The box opens on what the code is spaced at today, so the number you adjust is the cadence the command already has rather than a blank.

Spacing is exact on ESPHome and Broadlink emitters, which accept the whole burst in a single call and lay it out to the microsecond. Anything else keeps sending one frame per call at its own pace, and the editor says so under the field rather than promising a cadence it cannot hold. It also says when a code is simply longer than the spacing asked for, in which case the presses go out back to back, and it refuses a combination that would hold the air for more than three seconds. Commands and signals saved before this existed carry no spacing and transmit exactly as they always did; opening one and saving it is what gives it a value.

### Device settings and power sensing

IR devices are send-only, so HAIR normally has to assume a command landed. Any device that plausibly draws current (AC, media player, fan, light, switch) shows a small settings button beside its emitter picker; open it to point a power sensor at the device, such as a smart plug's wattage reading. Set two thresholds, and the device counts as off at or below the lower one and on at or above the higher one, with a live reading shown once a sensor is picked. Readings that cross a threshold override what HAIR assumed from the last command sent, and keep doing so across a Home Assistant restart, so a device switched off with its original remote stops claiming to be on. Devices without a sensor still restore their last-known state after a restart instead of resetting to blank.

On a state-matrix climate device the same dialog also takes a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, or both, and the thermostat card shows a live reading under each. Display only, and a sensor reporting in a different unit than your installation converts automatically.

### A few more things

- **Emitter routing** -- each device can be pinned to one emitter or broadcast through several, so an AC command stays in one room while a TV Power command reaches every room at once.
- **Ten languages** -- the panel and setup wizard follow your Home Assistant profile language automatically; see [Translations](#translations) below.
- **Glossary** -- the words HAIR uses (Device, Remote, wig, fitting, pin, comb) are defined in [docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md).

### Entity platforms

| Type | HA entity | Controls |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Media Player | `media_player` | Power, volume, mute, source, channels, navigation, transport |
| AC | `climate` | HVAC modes, temperature presets or a full state matrix, fan modes, swing |
| Fan | `fan` | Power, speed stepping or direct speed levels (1-10), oscillate |
| Light | `light` | On/off, brightness stepping |
| Switch | `switch` | On/off |
| Screen | `cover` | Open, close, stop |
| Other | `remote` | Generic IR command sender |

Every device also gets a `remote` entity for arbitrary Pronto codes and a `button` entity for each learned command.

### ESPHome hardware

If your ESPHome device already has `remote_transmitter` and `remote_receiver` blocks, one addition registers both on HA's native `infrared` platform:

```yaml
infrared:
  - platform: ir_rf_proxy
    name: IR Emitter
    id: ir_proxy_tx
    remote_transmitter_id: ir_tx     # your remote_transmitter id
  - platform: ir_rf_proxy
    name: IR Receiver
    id: ir_proxy_rx
    receiver_frequency: 38kHz
    remote_receiver_id: ir_rx        # your remote_receiver id
```

Reflash, and the Devices tab shows the emitter with a `TX-NATIVE` badge and the receiver with `RX-NATIVE`.

For ready-made configs for common ESP32 boards (XIAO Smart IR Mate, Athom RF IR Remote, M5Stack IR Unit, generic ESP32s), see [`esphome/`](esphome/) in this repo.

#### Air conditioners and long messages

The `idle` value above is how much silence ends a capture. ESPHome's own default is 10 ms, and that is shorter than the gaps inside a single air conditioner message: a Daikin press carries about 35 ms of silence in the middle of it. At 10 ms the receiver closes the capture in those gaps, so one press arrives as several codes, and because each piece looks like a different signal it can show up as several remotes in the Sniffer.

100 ms is the value to use. It is field-proven on the units in this folder and it comfortably clears the longest in-message gap those protocols use. The trade-off at very high values is the opposite problem: hold a button down and the repeats start merging into one capture instead of arriving as separate presses. HAIR's decoders split a merged capture back into frames per protocol, and 100 ms is well inside the range where that works, so it is a safe place to sit.

<details>
<summary>Legacy bridge for HA 2026.4-2026.5 (only if you cannot upgrade)</summary>

Before native `InfraredReceiverEntity` shipped in HA 2026.6, HAIR received signals over an event-bus bridge. If you are stuck on 2026.4 or 2026.5, add this to your ESPHome device's `remote_receiver` block:

```yaml
remote_receiver:
  id: ir_receiver
  pin:
    number: GPIO5   # your IR receiver data pin
    inverted: true
  dump: pronto
  on_pronto:
    then:
      - homeassistant.event:
          event: esphome.remote_received
          data:
            protocol: "PRONTO"
            code: !lambda 'return x.data;'
```

This fires every IR signal as a `homeassistant.event` on the HA bus, and the HAIR Sniffer subscribes automatically. The panel shows `RX-BRIDGE` on the receiver card while this path is in use. When you upgrade to 2026.6+, add the `infrared` platform receiver entry above and reflash; HAIR switches over automatically, and you can remove the `on_pronto:` block once `RX-NATIVE` appears.

</details>

### Translations

HAIR speaks ten languages, and eight of them need a native-speaker review. Spanish has one already (thanks @Waterbrain). French, Japanese, German, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian, and Russian were drafted by a programming assistant and are marked "reviewer wanted" inside each dictionary file. A native-speaker pass over one file is all it takes, and your name goes in the file as its reviewer. See [Adding a language](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-language).
